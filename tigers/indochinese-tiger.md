It is difficult to find these tigers as they tend to live up very high in the mountains in isolated areas. That doesn’t mean they aren’t in jeopardy though because that just means people have to try harder to find them. Many hunters find this additional challenge to be what thrills them and entices them to go on such hunts. These remote areas also mean it is harder for them to get busted by authorities for illegal killing of the Indochinese Tigers.
