![Malayan Tiger]({{site.baseurl}}/img/malayan-tiger.jpg)

This is the newest species of tiger to be identified as it has only been recognized as a subspecies since 2004. They are the smallest in size of all the species of tigers. They are very often confused with the Sumatran Tiger due to their small size and their coloring. In fact, some people think that they are looking at photos of a young tiger instead of one that is a full grown adult with this species.

The main food source for these smaller tigers are deer and livestock. The fact that they kill large numbers of livestock doesn’t go over very well with humans. In fact, it is believed that this is the biggest threat to them. Humans want to destroy them so that they can’t continue to destroy their livestock. The Malayan Tiger is also known to kill humans but again that is likely due to a lack of prey to choose from and the fact that humans are moving into their natural habitat.
