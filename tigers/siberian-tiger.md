The siberian tiger is the largest of all tigers. They are reddish-rusty or rusty-yellow in color, with narrow black transverse stripes. In 2005, there were 331â€“393 adult Amur tigers in the mountain region, with a breeding adult population of about 250 individuals. The population has been stable for more than a decade due to intensive conservation efforts, but partial surveys conducted after 2005 indicate that the Russian tiger population is declining.
