# A streak of Tigers

Easily recognized by its coat of reddish-orange with dark stripes, a tiger is the largest wild cat in the world. The big cat weighs up to 720 pounds (363 kilograms), stretches 6 feet (2 meters) long, and has a 3-foot- (1-meter-) long tail.

The reason why I chose this topic is because I think tigers are a very fascinating creatures to learn about. They are one of the predators on the top of the food chain and act like they are kings. 

## Purpose

This project is a school project to learn about making design systems for large-scale websites.

I'm excited to learn about how to make large-scale websites that are beautifully designed, which still being user-friendly. I am also excited learning about tigers, specifically, ever since I watch the movie, Life of Pie.
