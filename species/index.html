      <h2>Tigers in the Wild</h2>
      <p>While, Richard Parker was located in India, there are many tigers that have once ranged widely across Asia, from Turkey in the west to the eastern coast of Russia. Over the past 100 years, they have lost 93% of their historic range, and have been extirpated from southwest and central Asia, from the islands of Java and Bali, and from large areas of Southeast and Eastern Asia. The Bengal tiger is the national animal of both India and Bangladesh.</p>

      <h2>Facts about Tigers</h2>
      <p>Tigers wait until dark to hunt. Once a tiger has spotted its prey, it sneaks as close as possible to its victim. Then the tiger sprints to the unsuspecting animal, usually pulling it off its feet with its teeth and claws. If the prey animal is large, the tiger bites its throat to kill it; smaller prey is usually killed when the tiger breaks its neck.</p>
      <p>Tigers that live in cold northern areas are usually bigger and heavier than those that live in tropical habitats.</p>

      <p>No two tigers have exactly the same pattern of stripes.</p>

      <p>A tiger retracts its claws as it walks, leaving no claw marks in its tracks.</p>
